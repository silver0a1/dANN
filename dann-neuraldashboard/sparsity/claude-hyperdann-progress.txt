concepts to implement for the hyper-dANN:

-learning rate decay or other adaptive learning method: what is the trigger/threshold/method
-early stopping with patience for epochs
-investigate attention mechanism ie does hyper-dANN replace the need for attention heads
-known context vs unknown context ie do we use a RNN to determine context for the hypernetwork?
-investigate adaptable architecture to expand on last point: what is the trigger/threshold/method
-seed randomization to test stability



NLP tasks:
-encoder (vocabulary BPE) to feed text to RNN network (fixed or adaptive:beamsearch)
-decoder (vocabulary also BPE for consistency) to output text. My understanding is a method of vocabulary is needed. (fixed or adaptive:beamsearch)
