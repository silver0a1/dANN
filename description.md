This project is an exploration of a novel neural network architecture called a "Dendritic Neuron" and its application to various machine learning problems. The code implements both standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the custom Dendritic Artificial Neural Network (dANN) architecture in Go.

Here's a breakdown of the project's components and purpose:

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Standard ANN vs. Dendritic Neuron (dANN):** The project contrasts a traditional ANN with a custom "Dendritic Neuron" model.
    *   **ANN:** The `ann_sine_approximation.go` and `ann_sine_reimplemented.go` files implement a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with basic components like neurons and layers. It uses backpropagation for training.
    *   **Dendritic Neuron (dANN):** The `dendritic_neuron.go` file introduces the core custom component. This neuron has an internal structure of "dendritic compartments," each of which processes the input independently. The outputs of these compartments are then combined in a "soma" to produce the final neuron output. This is a more complex, two-stage processing model within a single neuron, inspired by biological neurons. The `dann_` prefixed files all use this dendritic model.

*   **Learning and Problem Solving:** The various files demonstrate how these two architectures (ANN and dANN) are trained to solve different types of problems:
    *   **Function Approximation:** `ann_sine_approximation.go`, `ann_sine_reimplemented.go`, and `dann_sine_approximation.go` attempt to learn the function `z = sin(x*y)`. This is a regression task.
    *   **Classification:**
        *   `dann_reimplemented_xor.go`, `dendritic_neuron.go`: Solve the classic XOR problem, a simple binary classification task.
        *   `dann_iris.go`: Classifies the famous Iris flower dataset into three species (multi-class classification).
        *   `dann_tumor.go`: Classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on features (binary classification).
        *   `dendritic_neuron_circle.go`, `dendritic_neuron_ring.go`, `dendritic_neuron_two_circles.go`, `dendritic_neuron_checkerboard.go`, `dendritic_neuron_spirals.go`, `dendritic_neuron_xor_circles.go`: These files test the dANN's ability to learn complex, non-linear decision boundaries, which are notoriously difficult for simple models.
    *   **Regression:**
        *   `dann_boston_housing.go`: Predicts house prices from the Boston Housing dataset.

**Project Goal:**

The primary goal of this project seems to be to **evaluate the capabilities of the Dendritic Neuron architecture**. By implementing both a standard ANN and the dANN and testing them on a wide range of problems, the author is likely trying to:

1.  **Benchmark Performance:** Compare the dANN's accuracy, training speed, and ability to solve complex problems against a standard ANN.
2.  **Explore Non-linearity:** Test the hypothesis that the dendritic structure provides a more powerful way to model complex, non-linear relationships in data (as suggested by the various geometric classification tasks).
3.  **Showcase the dANN:** Demonstrate the implementation and application of this novel neuron architecture.

In essence, this is a research-oriented project implemented in Go to explore and validate a new neural network design. The different files are individual experiments applying the dANN to a suite of classic and challenging machine learning tasks.
